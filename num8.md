# OO Design 

## Don't repeat yourself 

The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle tell us that to not duplicate our code and to use abstraction; duplication in process should be replaced by a dynamic code. Adding additional, unnecessary code to a codebase increases the amount of work required to extend and maintain the software in the future.

## Rule of Three 

>It is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. It states that you are allowed to copy and paste the code once, but that when the same code is replicated three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure 
[source](https://wou.edu/las/cs/csclasses/cs161/Lectures/rulesofthumb.html)

You can always use functional programming to eliminate the repeated usage of code and to ensure that your code is dynamic and adjustable at any time.

## You Aren’t Gonna Need It

>"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.

Even if you're sure that you'll need a feature later, don't implement it now. Usually, it'll turn out either that you don't need it after all, or what you actually need is quite different from what you really need.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

A minimum viable product, or MVP, is a product with enough features to attract first customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle. In industries such as software, the MVP can help the product team receive user feedback as quickly as possible to iterate and improve the product.
