# MY SUBMISSIONS FOR 301 (Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development)

&nbsp;


We have been introduced to React framework on course 301 week 1, we learned about components and build a single page sit by building component and re-rendering them, we also learned how to pass functions and variable through components.<br>
 At week 2, we learned about API's and how to use their data on our apps, then we built our own API and used its data on our app. <br>
 At the final week, we learned how to set-up a database to store our app data and re-use it whenever we need, we used REST to handle the transitions between the server and the app and database.
