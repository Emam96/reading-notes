#   CSS 
This a summary of what I have learned during the class and by reading [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS) tutorial.

First, we need to know what is CSS stands for, it's simply a styling tool, while HTML structure the webpage, CSS presents it with the design.





&nbsp;



There 3 types that you can add CSS lines to the HTML file: 
- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS


&nbsp;



The External CSS means that you define a sole file just for the CSS so you can implement its command to the whole page, and you need to connect to the HTML page using:
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">`


&nbsp;

The internal CSS means that you can assign a special unique style for one page and type it between the HTML code using `<style> `



&nbsp;


The Inline CSS allows you to assign one single element with some special attributes by adding in inside the same tag, for example: 
- <h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
