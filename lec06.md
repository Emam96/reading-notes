## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming 

&nbsp;


### 1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming? 

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

&nbsp;


### 2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? 

Learning from fellow students is the most beneficial in our situation, as we are training to become good web developers, every information you can gain is important. 

&nbsp;


### 3. How does pair programming work?

It involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.[1]
