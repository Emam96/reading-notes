#   GIT 
This a summary of what I have learned during the class and by reading [this](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/) tutorial. 

&nbsp;


First, we need to know what is GIT stands for,
>  it is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

We use git to upload our work  to a digital platform, If you asked me about it, I can say that it has many benefits: 
 -  Back-up your code so you won't lose it.
- Can share it easily and work with teams.
- Keep a log of the changes implemented on the code so you can track any errors easily.

## NAVIGATIONS 


- pwd: show the file path.
- ls: list content 
- ls -la: show all content (including hidden)
- cd: change directory 
- cd ..: go back in terminal (parent)
- cd ../.. : go back in terminal (grandparent)
- mkdir : create a file
- touch: create a folder 
- clear: clear the lines
- you can make spaces by type inside 'single quotations'



&nbsp;


##  CLONING 
What we mean by cloning is that we import an existing project or directory into Git
You can create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server by using the clone with a repository’s URL:

 `git clone https://github.com/reading-notes`




&nbsp;





## COMMITING 
This is the commands that we use to submit our progress, or "commting"

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "describe what you did, because it's your fault"
3. git push origin `branch name`
