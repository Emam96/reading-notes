## Spring Initializr.

Spring Initializr provides an extensible API to generate JVM-based projects with implementations for several common concepts:

* Basic language generation for Java, Kotlin and Groovy.

* Build system abstraction with implementations for Apache Maven and Gradle.

* .gitignore support.

* Several hook-points for custom resources generations.

## Spring Boot Devtools 

Spring Boot gives us the ability to quickly setup and run services.

Adding spring-boot-devtools in a project is as simple as adding any other spring-boot module. In an existing spring-boot project, add the following dependency:

`<dependency>`<br>
    `<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>`<br>
    `<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>`<br>
`</dependency>`<br>


## Spring model attributes

>One of the most important Spring-MVC annotations is the @ModelAttribute annotation. The @ModelAttribute is an annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute and then exposes it to a web view.
