#   Expressions and Operators
This a summary of what I have learned during the class and by reading [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) tutorial. 

## Logical operators
&nbsp;


We can use Logical operators to make the code more readble and to merge many IF statments in one function: 
- && the AND operator.
 > Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.
- || the OR operator
>Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, || returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns false.
- ! logical NOT
>Returns false if its single operand that can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.

## LOOPS

Loops make it easier to repeat a function, for now, we will mention 2 types of loops. they are: 


1. FOR loop  we use when we want to perform a task for a known number of times  `for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement`




2. WHILE loop we use this when we want to repeat the action for an unknown number of times `while (condition)
  statement`
