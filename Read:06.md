#   JavaSCRIPT 
This a summary of what I have learned during the class and by reading [this](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp) tutorial. 


&nbsp;


First, we need to know what is JavaScript, well, it's the real program on the webpage, and it is from those light languages that it will be stored at the page memory itself. It's object-oriented meaning that it relies on the concept of classes and objects.





&nbsp;



There are 3 components that we need to know: 
- Variables
- Identifiers
- Data Types


&nbsp;



1. **Variables** means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime. JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name.
- `var y = 10;`


&nbsp;

2. **Identifiers** An identifier is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a variable, function, or property. In JavaScript, identifiers are case-sensitive and can contain Unicode letters,and digits, but may not start with a digit.    
 &nbsp; 
  `x, y ,Y, emam maybe idk `



&nbsp;


3. **Data Types** JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
- Numbers = var HQ = 66;
- String = lastName = "Bond"; .... James Bond
- An Object itself (can you belive that) = var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};
