# GROWTH MINDSET
 The growth mindset can open pathways to more **creativity** and **possibility**, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.
 
 Growth orianted mindsets are optimistic and see the positive side when dealing with life events and challengs, The first step to get into this mood is to organaize and to clear your mind from any bad concerns that might cause Stress and anxiety, the next important thing is to choose the type of people who you want to be around and can inhance those thought and not the opposite, for sure by Encouraging you and from the **Objective criticism**  that they will give. Its important to note as well that a written ***plan and clear goals*** are a must to ensure that you are channelling your efforts correctly and make a real progress.

   It is unrealistic to say that you should always stay calm and be ignorant to any bad thing happens to you, what we are trying to say that you should try to learn from those
   events that might occur and use them to stack some experience and new ways to prevent or avoid them next time, its simply what makes progress.
