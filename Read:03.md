#   HTML
This a summary of what I have learned during the class and by reading [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) tutorial. 


&nbsp;


First, we need to know what is HTML stands for, it's a language that is used to structure a web page and its content.





&nbsp;



HTML codes use TAGS, tags are used to give a specific form for a line on the webpage, any line between tags called ELEMENT, for example:
- `<p>My name is Emam.</p>`
&nbsp;   
tags arent visible on the page so what will be showen is `My name is Emam`





&nbsp;



## MAIN TAGS

1. **<!DOCTYPE html>** — it act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML.
2. **<html></html>** — the <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page.
3. **<head></head>** — the <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.
4. **<title></title>** — the <title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. 
5. **<body></body>** — the <body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, and it contain another sub tags,header, main and footer.

## LINKS 

You can add links with this simple code right here: &nbsp;

`<a href="https://github.com/Emam96">Emam96</a>`    and it should be active on your page
