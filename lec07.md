### 2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? 

because machines don't have a universal noun.  Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns.

&nbsp;


### 3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.

### 4. What does a GET do?

 Using the HTTP protocol to retrieve all the resources until the web page is displayed.

&nbsp;


 ### 5. What does a POST do?

 If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

&nbsp;


 ### 6. What does PUT do? 

 If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT. 

&nbsp;


 ### 7. What does PATCH do?

 If a system wants to update something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PATCH.
