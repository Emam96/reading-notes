# Arrays, Loops, Imports

## Import

### Import

Java gives you the advantage of pre-built classes and methods that can perform many functions, The classes are grouped in  packages that must be imported into your project if you want to use them.

For example, if you want to use the `scanner` methods, you will need to access the library by placing this line on top of your code:

>import java.util.Scanner;

### Loops

1. **For Loop**<br>
We use for loops when you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code.
the syntax is: <br>
**for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {<br>
  System.out.println(i);<br>
}**

&nbsp;


2. **While Loop**<br>
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
the syntax is: <br>
**while (condition) {<br>
  // code block to be executed<br>
}**


&nbsp;


For a detailed example, have a look at the dedicated post: Java While Loop.

3. **Do-While Loop**<br>
It is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
the syntax is: <br>
**do {<br>
  // code block to be executed<br>
}<br>
while (condition);**<br>
